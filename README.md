pybtchat is a simple chat program (one to one) that uses bluetooth technology. This program is written in python and it requires pygtk, pybluez and pynotify to work. I welcome any comments, suggestions, patches, or feedback you have on this program. Please direct all correspondence to angelo.poerio@gmail.com .

Note: It could not work well on new version of python
